### 🗓️ August 6, 2025

#### 🎯 Plan for Today
- Practice core Git skills: branch, merge, push
- Reflect in journal and track changes

#### ✅ What I Did
- Created `test-branch`
- Made a change to README
- Merged and deleted branch
- Understood push/pull origin differences

#### 💡 Reflections / Learning
- Merging helps test features before main
- Terminal Git is smoother than VS Code for now
